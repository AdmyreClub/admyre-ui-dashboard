//tracking api to be made from:



// primary aim is to create two paths: one for tracking posts & profiles and another for importing profiles both one by one and in bulk

// for first part: tracking posts and profiles, they will have to either select a campaign or strategy -> list respectively

// for second part: importing profiles in bulk and one by one, the interface will be similar to insttrack in that regards -> infact completely same, with an option to
// in bulk as well
